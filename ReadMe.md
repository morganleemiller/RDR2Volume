This is a simple Console application that will poll for the RDR2 process and set the volume to 100% every 30 seconds. This is meant to be a simple work around until the game it patched(hopefully). This was helpful to me when using Steam Remote play and I didn't have direct access to the PC to manually adjust the colume.
